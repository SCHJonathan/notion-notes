# Some of my Notion Notes I'd like to share

A quote from one of my favorite programmer (also a streamer)'s [blog](https://robs.io/) to start this repo.

> So, I guess I’m just taking a moment to realize what matters most, and enjoying the silent comradery with amazing engineers, all of us “building civilization” together in our own quiet workshops, taking an occasional glance at the Trump/Kim Kardashian madness of the popular world, and then quietly smiling and turning back to our work like Mr. Horologist adjusting his glasses as he looks back at his watches.

> There, I feel better.

This repo mainly contains some notes I took while reading some books, or some thoughts that I'd love to share over the internet. 

Sorry if you find any mistakes or typos from my writings and feel free to open an issue / make a pull request. Just hope everyone has a great day. 😆
